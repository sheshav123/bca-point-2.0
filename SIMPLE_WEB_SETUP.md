## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "404 - Page not found"
**Solution:** Wait 5 more minutes. GitHub Pages takes time to deploy.

### Problem: "Can't sign in with Google"
**Solution:** Make sure you added `sheshav123.github.io` to Firebase authorized domains (Step 2)

### Problem: Still see red crosses in Actions
**Solution:** Ignore them! We're using the `/docs` folder method instead, which is simpler.
